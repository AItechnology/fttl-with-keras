# Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning for Cross Domain Image Classification with Keras

Supporting code for my talk at [Accel.AI](http://accel.ai/) Demystifying Deep Learning and AI event on November 19-20 2016 at Oakland CA.

## Abstract:

I describe how a Deep Convolutional Network (DCNN) trained on the ImageNet dataset can be used to classify images in a completely different domain. The intuition that the training process teaches the DCNN to extract good features from images is explored with visualizations. Transfer Learning freezes the bottom layers of the DCNN to extract image vectors from a training set in a different domain, which can then be used to train a new classifier for this domain. Fine tuning involves training the pre-trained network further for the target domain. Both approaches are demonstrated using a VGG-16 network pre-trained on ImageNet to classify medical images into 5 categories. Code examples are provided using Keras.

## Dataset

Dataset used comes from [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection) on Kaggle. Dataset is a set of 35,126 of digital color fundus photographs of the retina. The code here uses a sample of 1,000 images sampled from this dataset, 200 per each of the 5 Diabetes Retinopathy images (No DR, Mild DR, Moderate DR, Severe DR and Proliferative DR). See the [data/README.md](data/README.md) for details.

### Transfer Learning + 2 layer MLP

Results in lower performance than 1 layer MLP. Other tuning was to increase batch size, use Adadelta optimizer with lower learning rate. Network is slower because of additional layer and slightly worse in performance than 1 layer.
